There's tons of other mouse tool websites out there! Why are you looking at this vibecoded slop that uses no libraries?

Bugs:
  Probably don't know - It wasn't just a simple gimmick website created by a LLM hater, but a professional Claude clocked into work.

Features:
- Left out features?
- DPI Ruler
- Sniper Practice (Or Claude might add an actual sniper practice similar to Hitman 3, but then fail because this isn't a 3D project)
- Target Clicking
- Flicking
- DDay Exploiter Combat

The Claude setup I used was the Claude website (claude.ai) with custom instructions pointing it to refine its work using the artifact edit function if it wasn't satisfied, and having multiple files in one artifact

Claude may or may have not minified some JS like Gemini does for some reason
And also created a COPY of tracking for dday instead of just 'configing' it differently using classes, but who cares it's AI code it's gonna fix it anyway
